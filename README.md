# Tableau
Using Tableau to perform Citibike data visualizations provided by Citi Bike (https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data). Monthly datasets from 2013 to 2019 csv files were collected from the Citi Bike website, and were initially loaded into Tableau Public to perform a quick data checkup of which abnormal datasets were detected via filtering. The abnormal csv files were then loaded into Python to perform fixes such as matching the column names consistently, and saved as fixed.csv files.
All the csv files, along with the fixed csv files, were re-loaded into Tableau Public, however, due to limitations and performance issues from the Tableau Public version, only a certain amount of datasets were able to be analyzed.
The chosen datasets were of 2017 citibike data. More year datasets will be added if necessary, and if a Tableau program higher than Tableau Public can be utilized.
